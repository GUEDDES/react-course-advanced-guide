# Module 20: Final Performance Project

## 🎯 Project: Optimize a Slow App

### Scenario

You're given a slow React application with multiple performance issues:

- Large bundle size (2 MB)
- Slow initial load (8s)
- Poor Core Web Vitals
- Memory leaks
- Unnecessary re-renders

### Tasks

1. **Analyze Performance**
   - [ ] Run Lighthouse audit
   - [ ] Use React DevTools Profiler
   - [ ] Analyze bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer
   - [ ] Measure Web Vitals

2. **Code Splitting**
   - [ ] Split routes with React.lazy
   - [ ] Split heavy components
   - [ ] Reduce bundle to < 500 KB

3. **Optimize Rendering**
   - [ ] Add React.memo where needed
   - [ ] Use useMemo/useCallback
   - [ ] Implement virtual scrolling
   - [ ] Reduce re-renders by 70%

4. **Asset Optimization**
   - [ ] Convert images to WebP
   - [ ] Implement lazy loading
   - [ ] Add responsive images
   - [ ] Reduce image payload by 60%

5. **Improve Web Vitals**
   - [ ] LCP < 2.5s
   - [ ] FID < 100ms
   - [ ] CLS < 0.1

6. **Add Monitoring**
   - [ ] Integrate web-vitals
   - [ ] Setup error tracking
   - [ ] Create performance dashboard

### Deliverables

- [ ] Before/After metrics report
- [ ] Lighthouse score improvement
- [ ] Bundle size comparison
- [ ] Documentation of changes

### Success Criteria

- 🎯 Lighthouse Performance Score > 90
- 🎯 Bundle size < 500 KB
- 🎯 LCP < 2.5s
- 🎯 All Core Web Vitals "Good"
